# Tuples 
# A Tuple looks just like a list,except you use ()parentheses instead of square brackets [].Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by using each items's index, just as you would for a list. 

# Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable and an immutable list is called Tuple.
